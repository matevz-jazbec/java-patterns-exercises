# Window

The solution is provided in the file Window.java.  
Open it to see the Java implementation of the pattern.

This program draws a rectangular "window" with a full border and a vertical bar in the center.  
The figure uses `*` for the border and the center bar, and spaces elsewhere.

Concepts practiced: nested loops, parameterized dimensions, borders, center column, console output.

---

## Task

Implement a method `drawWindow(int n)` that prints a window pattern with:
- Height = `n + 2`
- Width  = `3 * n`
- Top and bottom rows are a full border of `*`.
- Interior rows have `*` at the first and last column, and a `*` at the center column.
- All other positions are spaces.

When `n <= 0`, no visible characters are printed.

---

## Example output

For `n = 3` (width = 9, height = 5):

```
*********
*   *   *
*   *   *
*   *   *
*********
```

> Tip: This README uses spaces for empty cells to keep the pattern clean. If you need to debug alignment, temporarily replace spaces with a visible character (e.g., `·`).

## How to compile and run

From the `window` directory:

```bash
javac Window.java
java Window
```

In this implementation, the value of `n` is fixed to 3 inside the code.
